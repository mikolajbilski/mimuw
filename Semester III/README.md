# Third semester

Folder contains solutions to assigments I was working on during the third semester of CS studies.

**Third semester courses:**
- Concurrent programming
- Data structures and algorithms
- Advanced C++ course
- Databases
- Probability
- Programming in Rust (normally a 3rd year course, which I'm doing in advance)

NOTE: this is work-in-progress, more solutions will be shared here after the semester ends
