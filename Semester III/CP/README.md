# Concurrent programming

The following tasks were assigned to me for the Concurrent programming course:

**Parallel logic gates (cp2024/)**

Implement a library in Java that solves circuits of logic gates concurrently.
Only the contents of solution/ folder are my work, the rest was provided as part of the task.

**Parallel verification of a combinatorics theorem (combinatorics/)**

Implement a library in C that concurrently verifies via bruteforce a certain combinatorics theorem.
This task required Implementing a parallel stack, sharing tasks between threads and optimizing various parameters of the algorithm to
ensure optimal parallelization factor.
Only the contents of parallel/ and noncrecursive/ folders are my work, the rest was provided as part of the task.
