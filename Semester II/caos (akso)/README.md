# Computer architecture and operating systems

The following tasks were assigned to me for the Computer architecture and operating systems course:

**NAND gates (nand.c)**

Implement a library that simulates NAND logic gates.
This task showcases proficiency with memory management in C.

**Division (div.asm)**

Implement a function in assembly to divide two numbers using long division.
One of the aspects of this task was to create as small executable as possible.

**CRC (crc.asm)**

Write an assembly program that computes CRC for a given file and polynomial.
This task showcases the ability to write complete assembly programs featuring file I/O and error handling.
